# Admin Member Penalty Contract

Part of the [Admin Rulebook](admin-rulebook.md). Defines accepted policy for the Misconduct penalty ladder, Low-Average-Review ladder, Red Flags, Member Bans, and the `memberPenaltyRecord` audit trail.

## Two independent ladders

Member penalties operate through two independent ladders. A Member's strike count on one never affects the other.

---

## 1. Misconduct ladder

Triggered when an Admin confirms a violation:
- a `REPORT_CASE_HIDDEN` Moderation Decision on a sent Message; or
- a `CONDUCT_REPORT_UPHELD` decision on a Quest Conduct Report.

### Penalty tiers

| Confirmed-violation count | Result | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st strike | Red Flag | 7 days (`PC-09`) |
| 2nd strike | Temporary ban + Wallet Auto-Freeze | 7 days (`PC-11`) |
| 3rd strike | Permanent ban | Permanent |

### Rules and exemptions

- **Red Flag**: Visible on Member Profile, mini-profile during Candidate selection, and Hirer identity on Quest pages. Blocks applying as Candidate, joining FCFS Quests, and **publishing new Quests**. Runs existing Quests unchanged. Expires automatically after 7 days without Admin intervention.
- **Temporary ban (2nd strike)**: Denies sign-in for 7 days. Auto-freezes Wallet in the same action; auto-restores Wallet to `ACTIVE` upon expiry.
- **Permanent ban (3rd strike)**: Denies sign-in permanently and auto-freezes Wallet. Read directly from `memberPenaltyRecord`.
- **Exemptions (`PC-12` & `PC-13`)**:
  - The first 10 (`PC-12`) confirmed violations after account creation do not advance the ladder.
  - The first 3 (`PC-13`) confirmed violations after a temporary or permanent ban lifts do not advance the ladder.
  - A Member's 1st result (Red Flag) arrives at confirmed violation 11, 2nd result (Temp ban) at violation 12, and 3rd result (Permanent ban) at violation 13.
- **Reversals**: A `REPORT_CASE_RESTORED` decision cancels the strike created by its earlier `REPORT_CASE_HIDDEN` decision. Writes a linked reversing row in `memberPenaltyRecord` without deleting the original row, immediately clearing any Red Flag or ban produced by that strike. (Conduct Report strikes cannot be reversed).
- **Assignments during bans**: A banned Member's active Assignments are not force-cancelled. The standard deadline and Start Work rules apply; unfulfilled work fails via standard rules.

## 2. Low-Average-Review ladder

Fully automatic system evaluation (not Admin-triggered):

| Downward crossing count | Result | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st strike | Temporary ban | 7 days |
| 2nd strike | Temporary ban | 1 month |
| 3rd strike | Permanent ban | Permanent |

### Rules

- Triggers only once a Member has received at least **10 Reviews**.
- From the 10th Review onward, each time a new Review causes the Member's running average rating to cross from &ge;3.0 down to below 3.0, that crossing counts as one violation.
- Further Reviews received while the average remains below 3.0 do not increment the count. A new strike occurs only on subsequent downward crossings after recovering to &ge;3.0.
- `PC-12` and `PC-13` exemptions do not apply to this ladder.
- Evaluated only upon Review creation. Review edits within the 7-day window update displayed ratings but never alter recorded strikes.

## 3. Data shape and persistence

- `authUser.bannedUntil` (nullable timestamp): Projected later expiry of temporary bans from both ladders for O(1) auth guard evaluation.
- `authUser.redFlagExpiresAt` (nullable timestamp): Projected Red Flag expiry.
- `memberPenaltyRecord` (immutable audit table): Source of truth for strikes, recording member, ladder (`MISCONDUCT` | `REVIEW`), source (`REPORT_CASE`, `CONDUCT_REPORT`, `REVIEW_AVERAGE`), sequence number, result, actor, reason, timestamp, and nullable reversal link.
